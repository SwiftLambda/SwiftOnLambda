I've found more libraries via the following method:

run ldd swiftcommand in Linux to find all referenced libraries
run swiftcommand, having coded it to import Foundation
see errors about missing libraries
add the missing libraries one by one until that error disappears.
I first tried adding all missing libraries but when you do that it segfaults. I don't know why.

I'm worried we're playing fast & loose with the linker here, since I presume it is not safe to assume that static libraries from ibmcom/kitura-swift are compatible with those from ubuntu:latest. Or am I wrong about that?
